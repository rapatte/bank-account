## Kata Statement

Bank Account kata for practice TDD implemented by [Jorge SÃ¡nchez (Xurxodev)](https://github.com/xurxodev/Bank-Account-Kata/blob/master/README.md)

Think of your personal bank account experience

When in doubt, go for the simplest solution

### Requirements

These are requirements for kata.

#### Initial requirements

* Deposit (negative not permitted)
* Withdrawal (negative not permitted)  
* GetBalance  
* Account statement (date, quantity, balance) 
* Statement printing 

#### Extra requirements if you feel with force :)

* Deposit and Withdrawal (EUR and USD)

## My Approach

### Technical stack 

I'm using NestJs.

### Story Mapping

Let's translate the features above into user stories :

* US1 : Deposit (negative not permitted)

> As a bank client, I want to make a deposit in my account.

* US2 : Withdrawal (negative not permitted)  

> As a bank client, I want to withdraw money from my account.

* US3 : GetBalance  

> As a bank client, I want to know the balkance in my account.

* US4 : Account statement (date, quantity, balance) 

> As a bank client, I want to see my account statement.

* US5 : Statement printing 

> As a bank client, I want to print my account statement.
